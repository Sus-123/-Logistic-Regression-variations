Assignments on Logistic Regression


Qn1 . Our task is to build a Logistic Regression based classification model that estimates an applicant's probability of getting admission to an institution based on the scores from those two examinations whose data have been provided here (you may use 70% data for training and 30% for testing). 

a part Qn1. 
Design a Predictor with two basic features which are given using Batch Gradient Descent Algorithm, Stochastic Gradient Algorithm and mini batch Gradient Descent algorithms (determining minibatch size is your choice- here it could be 10, 20, 30 etc.) with and without feature scaling and compare their performances in terms of % error in prediction.(only allowed to use NumPy library of Python, no other functions/libraries are allowed).   
b part Qn1. 
Inject more features from the data set in the model ( at least 6-9) and repeat (a)  

c part Qn1. 
Add regularization term and repeat (b). 


Qn2 . 
After gaining experience of solving problem No 1) Design a classifier using logistic regression on Cleveland Medical data set for heart disease diagnosis. The processed dataset with some 13 features have been given with a label that a patient has a heart disease (1) or not (0). This design should have a professional touch within your ML knowledge.

For data Set : 
data.csv is used  for Qn1 (all parts)
data2.scv used for Qn2 .
